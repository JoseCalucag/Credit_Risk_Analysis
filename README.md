 <h3> Overview of the analysis </h3>
Using a credit card dataset from LendingClub, this project will take a look at the factors that can help predict whether someone is a low or high credit risk. We will use the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build models so to then train and evaluate them using various algorthims. Firstly, we applied oversampling algorithms in RandomOverSampler and SMOTE and then used an undersampling algorithm in ClusterCentroids. Next, we used SMOTTEEN which combines oversampling and undersampling. Finally, we compared two machine mearning models in BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier. Once finished creating a model from each algorthm, we can evaluate the data from a generated report and make a recommendation whether or not the any of these six algorthims should be used to predict credit risk.

<h3> Results </h3> 
# here is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt) <br>
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. <br>
Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

<h3> Summary </h3>
# There is a summary of the results (2 pt) <br>
# There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt) <br>
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. 
If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
